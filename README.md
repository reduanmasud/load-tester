### Load Tester

A powerful and intuitive Load Tester application built using Python, `wrk`, and React. This tool is designed to evaluate the performance and scalability of web applications under various load conditions, providing a comprehensive solution for developers and DevOps teams.

#### Key Features

- **High Performance Load Generation**: Utilizes `wrk` to generate high levels of load with minimal resource consumption, simulating thousands of connections and requests per second.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with React, offering a clean, responsive, and interactive user experience for configuring load tests, initiating tests, and monitoring results.
- **Comprehensive Test Configuration**: Allows detailed customization of load test parameters to match realistic usage scenarios.
- **Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting**: Provides real-time feedback on key performance metrics such as response times, throughput, and error rates.
- **Scalability Analysis**: Helps determine how your application scales under increasing load conditions.
- **Integration with Python**: Ensures seamless operation and robust handling of test workflows.

#### Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Python manages the execution of `wrk` load tests, handles test configuration, and aggregates performance data.
- **Load Generation**: `wrk` generates high-concurrency load with low overhead and supports complex test scenarios.
- **Frontend**: Built with React, offering a modern single-page application (SPA) experience with a dashboard for real-time performance monitoring, test configuration forms, and result visualizations.

#### Use Cases

- **Performance Benchmarking**: Assess the baseline performance of your web application.
- **Scalability Testing**: Identify application behavior under increasing load.
- **Capacity Planning**: Determine the maximum load your infrastructure can handle.
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Pinpoint performance issues and optimization areas.

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/load-tester.git
   cd load-tester
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - **Backend**:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```sh
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the application**:
   - **Backend**:
     ```sh
     python app.py
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```sh
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

4. **Configure and run a load test**:
   - Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Configure your test parameters
   - Start the test and monitor results in real-time
